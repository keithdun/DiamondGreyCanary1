The Modernist Environmental Game for Governments
By UNITED KDAEG
2019
  







UNITED KDAEG is a Global Corporation specializing in Government Disaster Prevention, Real Estate Development and World Unity Leadership News. Diamond Grey Canary is a new game product designed to introduce the benefits of increased government efficiency incorporated in modernist philosophy. Make government organizations bigger, stronger and faster. Then raise environmental taxes on these organizations. This summarizes the game.The game illustrates how countries, dubbed The New EU, applying modernist philosophy not only become more financially efficient; but also more grounded in environmental products and services. Playing this game conceptualizes designing a CO2 reducing petroleum additive, environmental disaster insurance, environmental disaster team response systems and clean energy subway systems. The game also highlights related new future-based jobs.


  

UNITED KDAEG Introduces the game Diamond Grey Canary. This is a government environmental disaster prevention product. Play the game and prevent disasters.

Introduction To Premodernist, Modernist, Postmodernist and Enviro-modernist  Philosophies


Modernist philosophy is difficult to describe. But, the game Diamond Grey Canary highlights its important factors such as, speed and efficiency. Early jazz musicians like Duke Ellington (the famous African American jazz piano player) demonstrate speed while playing the piano. Top Gun (the movie about the United States Navy fighter pilot school) shows how pilots learn to maneuver as fast as possible. Early 20th-century assembly lines are another example of applied modernist philosophy. Assembly lines minimize time necessary to assemble products by defining specific assembly line methodologies and regulations. Modernist philosophy increases organizational efficiency and revenue, while reducing cost.


The game Diamond Grey Canary is designed to both enhance player large conglomerate organization problem-solving skills and help solve contemporary world environmental problems. Players are encouraged to practice quickly making decisions at the expense of possible mistakes. Speed does not imply reckless. But, it does suggest a “smartly” strategy.  In general “smartly” means “as fast as practically possible.”


Additionally, the game Diamond Grey Canary promotes globalism over nationalism. Nationalism pays dividends such as increased national autonomy. But, in the long run globalism financially outperforms nationalism. How? First, globalism combines more resources from multiple stakeholders in a way that minimizes manufacturing time and cost. Second, globalism increases regional worker knowledge specialization, while minimizing duplicated regional work. All this lowers government global manufacturing time and cost.


UNITED KDAEG counter-intuitively proposes larger government conglomerates. Private sector disaster prevention and support corporations initially would operate more efficiently than a conglomerate of large governments. But, this possible stellar private sector business growth and subsequent profits might also somehow lower governmental cash reserves too far. Accordingly, UNITED KDAEG does not want to risk possible future government environmental disaster caused bankruptcies. For this reason UNITED KDAEG prefers global environmental disaster plans that both raise large government conglomerate efficiency and government cash reserves.


Moreover; a private corporation - without government assistance - specializing in environmental disaster prevention and support would need many ships, planes, helicopters, vehicles and personnel. For example, a private corporation called to aid a large city after being hit by a category 5 or 6 hurricane would need many planes, helicopters, special land vehicles and personnel. Governments already have these heavy assets - saving some expense of private corporation heavy material acquisition cost. This allows private disaster prevention and support corporations to focus predominantly on computer system acquisition, and training the needed environmental disaster prevention and support personnel. UNITED KDAEG strongly advocates large governmental conglomerate assistance to private disaster prevention and support corporations.


In summary the Diamond Grey Canary game illustrates how countries can combine modernist maximizing speed and efficiency philosophies with globalist minimizing organizational time and cost philosophies. This induces successfully completing very large environmental products at a shared grand profit. Countries smartly working together can indeed profitize astronomically big expensive environmental projects. In this game countries deliver on time and under budget four new environmental products. Again, these are carbon reducing petroleum additives, global environmental disaster insurance, environmental disaster team response systems and renewable energy rail and subway trains. In the game Diamond Grey Canary modernism and globalism even achieve an extra bonus - thousands of future based jobs.


Premodernism, Modernism, Postmodernism and Enviro-modernism Background Needed for Understanding and Building Large Government Conglomerates
In Diamond Grey Canary the organizational structure of a country is reduced to and modeled with only four philosophical parameters - premodernism, modernism, postmodernism and enviro-modernism. Premodernism prioritizes religion, tradition and family. Modernism prioritizes time, efficiency and principles (rules). Postmodernism prioritizes multiplicity or increased variety. Enviro-modernism prioritizes solving environmental problems.  Hence, in this game each country has four socio-economic philosophical considerations. These are premodernism, modernism, postmodernism and enviro-modernism. See Table 1.

	Yellow Diamond
	  
 Modernism
	Favors speed, efficiency and rules.
	Blue Square
	  
Postmodernism
	Favors multiplicity. Multiplicity incorporates diverse discourse. But, it also introduces more variables - which may require more discussion, analysis, time and money to analyze and implement.
	Red Circle
	  
Enviro-modernism
	Favors the environment.
	Green Hexagon
	



In an imaginary world everyone would have the same core prioritized beliefs and philosophies. Their ideologies would align in a system of parallel vectors. But, this is not true in the real world. Real people and real countries have different core favored philosophies. However, to be most successful different countries must still work together. Arguably, the best way to achieve this is to focus on a more narrow set of core favored philosophies. In this game the core favored philosophies are narrowed down to modernism (speed, efficiency and rules); and enviro-modernism (protecting the environment).


Diamond Grey Canary Game Countries
The main countries in this game possibly join together as the new European Union (EU). They are Britain (BR), China (CH), Germany (GE), Russia (RU), USA (US), France (FR), Israel (IS), Japan (JA), Iran (IR), South Korea (SK), North Korea (NK), Ghana (GH), India (IN), the European Union (EU). and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).   Russia joins both the New EU and OPEC.  See Table 2.

UNITED KDAEG Theory of Organizational Structures and Design
A material scientist considers the desired properties of the desired final metal. Then they use a chart of the elements kind of mentality to choose the right chemicals to compose the final metal for the desired properties. In the same way UNITED KDAEG is attempting to design a grand global organizational conglomerate with specific properties. This grand organization must be modernist - rules-based, fast and efficient.


Also, this global organization must be capable of producing a petroleum additive that reduces CO2 emissions, an environmental disaster insurance plan and clean energy subway systems.  In chemistry an element's symbol on the chart of the elements includes certain attributes about the element. These atomic details define the element's ability to successfully combine with other elements for a specific chemical purpose. The UNITED KDAEG Theory of Organizational Structures and Design proposes a similar conglomerate country organization molecular illustration that substitutes premodern, modern, postmodern and enviro-modern country values for chemical molecular atoms.


First, the theory considers how the final conglomerate country organizational [molecular] structure should behave or act. In this Diamond Grey Canary game the overall organizational structure must be modernist. This means it must be rules-based, fast and efficient. Therefore, each country’s relative atomic components of premodern, modern, postmodern and enviro-modern components must be arranged to maximize overall country conglomerate speed and efficiency. Second, the theory recognizes that in this game; people and countries have four favored philosophical core belief axis - premodern God, modern efficiency, postmodern multiplicity and enviro-modern environmental preference. Third, the theory attempts to arrange these four philosophical country philosophies into a grand country organizational conglomerate capable of quickly achieving the desired global objectives. In summary this is how the game Diamond Grey Canary illustrates country conglomerate organizational behavior.


Diamond Grey Canary Game Country Chemical Organization Chart
The purpose of a game chemical organization chart is to help conceptualize more philosophically consistent larger country organizational conglomerates. In this game the chemical organization concept model substitutes premodern, modern, postmodern and enviro-modern symbols for atoms in a molecule. This rendering represents the idea of building very large country organizational conglomerates with the philosophical (atomic) components of premodern, modern, postmodern and enviro-modern principles. See UNITED UNITED KDAEG Diamond Grey Canary Game Organizational Atom Example below.


  

The above example atomic concept shows the European Union (EU) with four atomic philosophical axis - premodernism (yellow diamond), modernism (blue square), postmodernism (red circle) and enviro-modernism (green hexagon). Furthermore, when carefully examining a similar entire chemical organization molecule chart; there are related, implied organizational building-block philosophical rules. See UNITED KDAEG Diamond Grey Canary Game Chemical Organization Country Molecule Chart below.




  



First, find the symbolized Japan (JA), European Union (EU) and OPEC (OP) atoms above. Notice that these symbolized atoms appear to be sharing their blue, square modern symbols. This represents the KDAEG diplomatic concept of prioritizing negotiations between the European Union (EU), OPEC (OP) and Japan (JA) upon [blue] modernistic rules and efficiency.


Second, find the symbolized OPEC (OP), European Union (EU) and China (CH) atoms above. These symbolized atoms appear to be sharing their geen, hexagon enviro-modern symbols. This represents the KDAEG diplomatic concept of prioritizing negotiations between OPEC (OP), the European Union (EU) and China (CH) upon enviro-modern environmental priorities.

Sqecial Squares with premodern, modern, postmodern and enviro-modern symbols
These board squares are marked X10, X11, X12, X13, X14, X15, X16, blank, XX and XX.
These special squares on the game board represent additional game events that do not automatically happen when a game country token lands on these squares. These events require an additional die roll after landing on their squares. See example Special Squares with premodern, moder, postmodern and enviro-modern symbols below:


Example special squares with premodern, modern, postmodern and enviro-modern symbols:
  

  

  



Additionally, these squares have the following column codes:


Yellow Premodern Religion - No action
Blue Modern Efficiency - Action
Red Postmodern Multiplicity - No Action
Green Enviro-modern Environmental Protection and Rescue - Action


These squares model the Diamond Grey Canary thesis that there are four core decision philosophies - premodernism, modernism, postmodernism and enviro-modernism. In this game premodern religion and postmodern multiplicity are not used. Therefore, when a player game token lands on any of the above special squares with premodern, modern, postmodern and enviro-modern symbols; the player must throw dice again.


A die roll of 1 models a yellow premodern religion decision bias. No player Action results. The die must be rolled again.
A die roll of 2 models a blue modern efficiency bias. Player Action results. This means the event on the corresponding board square is considered to immediately happen.


A die roll of 3 models a red postmodern multiplicity bias. No player Action results. The die is rolled again.


A die roll of 4 - 6 models a green enviro-modern environmental protection and rescue bias. Player Action results. This means the event on the corresponding board square is considered to immediately happen.

	10% total trade value of countries is remitted to the New EU Organization in the form of an operations and administration tax. This money pays for New EU and UN ordinary operations.


10% total trade value of countries is remitted to the New EU Organization in the form of an environmental tax. This organizational tax may be used for environmental issues such as help developing a petroleum carbon emissions reduction additive. The tax revenue can also pay for environmental disaster insurance payments to reinsurers; and world environmental disaster team response systems. Finally, the tax may also aid developing environmentally friendly rail transportation and operation systems.




10% total trade value of countries saved for chronic homeless / HIV (or prior prostitution) job retraining and housing.  Why support the HIV people to this extent? These people are not causing any problems. They sit in their chairs and stare out the window. Why not support them?


Why should chronically homeless and prostitutes get this much support? Because they are human too! They have the same intelligence, big business desires and aptitude as everyone else. Why should they be automatically disqualified from jobs that they could definitely do with some training? For example, why are chronically homeless and prostitutes not considered for security, fashion design or computer programming jobs? Their only real drawback is previous bad luck. Bad luck is not fatal. Give these people housing, laundry facilities and medical plans with good dental and gym memberships; and they will shine as bright as everyone else! Give them cell phones and American Express debit cards. That's the first step.


Countries are estimated to retain 70% of their trade income for their own operations.

New EU Supercomputer World Team Rescue 1 Operations Environmental Emergency Command Center. Environmental Disaster Prevention Center.  Large
Digital Wall Maps and large center room (stand around) digital plot station maps. Supercomputers map all roads in a city. Digital watches provide estimated last-time-before-power outage person location data. Computers then give best rescue possibilities based upon current road, traffic and power availability. Responders prioritize responses according to the developing situation. The following emergency onsite story illustrates why supercomputer data makes a difference.
“Hey. Do you guys have insulin? The other guys only had bottled water. Are you Mr. Subaru? Yes. We have your insulin. Oh. Thank you!  Wait a minute! What about my friend. She needs more heart medication? Is she Sara Stewart? Yes. Remind her she is scheduled for a drone medical delivery at 10am tomorrow morning. Who are you? It doesn't matter. Have a good day.”


Additional supercomputer benefits
Why are supercomputers necessary? First, they bring global transparency to worldwide operations using real time data. This means that these machines track body current medication levels in real-time for millions of people.  Similarly, they can track real time expenses of global subway development projects worldwide - and help prevent surprise over budget expenditures. This is because every part of a subway train (worldwide) is tracked in real time and every part price change stored in a database. In other words supercomputer managerial control reduces global cost because every subway and train part acquisition worldwide is tracked using real time data.

Diamond Grey Canary Game Cards


Assume premodernism, modernism, postmodernism and enviro-modernism have four respective vectors that summarize the respective group interests. They can then be respectively labeled yellow, blue, red and green. Also assume that the modern (blue) and enviro-modern (green) are mutual groups working together. However, the premodern (yellow) and postmodern (red) are not not necessarily directly coordinated with the the modern (blue) and enviro-modern (green) group or vectors. This implies that the modern (blue) and enviro-modern (green) vectors are parallel. But, the premodern (yellow) and postmodern (red) vectors are not parallel to them. In other words in this game blue efficient Modern and green Environmental goals are coordinated.

Request lower club membership fees and less formal regulation. However, retaining enough control to maximize organizational efficiency is suggested. Global rail ownership should reduce new environmental friendly rail research and construction cost. Last, all of this new energy focus will add new energy jobs. Somebody must build, maintain and operate the environment friendly new  global rail systems.
	









Britain Game Character and Background.
Game cards:
  



  



The cards and game play emphasize the wisdom of offering to others what they want or value; and in return, getting their help. The British Brexit Dilemma offers a classic opportunity for the Britain player to explore this proposition. Brexit is the term describing Britain leaving the European Union (EU). Brexit assumes that Britain successfully increases trade with other countries outside of the European Union (EU). This must at least balance lost European trade when Britain leaves the EU.
The British obviously want this to be a successful proposition.


One way to avoid disaster, in an ordinary high stakes poker game, is to accurately guess not only what cards other players are holding, but also what cards they need. Similarly, the British player is advised to consider the aspirations of other countries both inside and outside the European Union. Then help achieve some of these issues. In return other countries will gladly help solve the British Brexit problem.


For example, assume Brexit is initially successful if Britain gets a grand deal between Japan, USA, the EU, China and Russia. Therefore, in this example the British player needs to please other players in the game representing Japan, USA, the EU (Note, in this game the EU is simply France and Germany), China and Russia.


In this game the British player attempts to gain the favor of other players by increasing Bombardier aircraft factories and facilities in their countries. Bombardier was chosen because it is already a fairly global corporation. See https://www.bombardier.com/en/worldwide-presence.html
Therefore, in this game increasing its facilities is assumed to be less costly to Britain than increasing facilities of another less global corporation or industry.


Assume the British player first builds a new Bombardier plant in the USA. That theoretically increases USA favor toward Brexit. Then Britain builds a Bombardier plant in Japan. That increases Japanese favor toward Brexit. Then in this game Britain Increases British importation of Russian oil. That raises Russian support of Brexit.


Next, the British player arranges for 30%  of the new USA Bombardier plant parts to be imported from China. The British player also builds another Bombardier plant in China. That strengthens Chinese favor Chinese favor of Brexit.


In this game example after establishing new Bombardier plants in other countries, the British player asks other countries such as the USA and China to help increase EU trade 25% above the British level of trade during its last year in the EU. That strengthens both German and French Brexit positions. If the EU is projected to be financially stronger after Brexit than before, it will likely increase Brexit favor.


Of course In the real world Britain knows it must increase worldwide trade with Japan, Russia, Iran, Israel, India, and Korea in order for Brexit to quickly succeed. This game provides a quick, overview of these concepts in the context of making a successful Brexit one of Britain’s key country goals.

Justification for British and Israeli Intelligence agencies


In the past year several high-level security issues have arisen. For example, the British government says the Russian government attacked an individual on British soil. The Russians deny. Then the Saudi government is accused of attacking an individual on foreign soil. The Saudi government denies. The prorblem is that most governments are not sure exactly who to believe.


The uncertainty is of concern to UNITED UNITED KDAEG. Imagine the following. The United Nations approve approve the petroleum additive deal. The European Union also approves. All key nations approve. ½ Trillion is raised. In 4 years the additive chemical formula is attained. Then somehow the formula is stolen. Then the same old story repeats itself. Certain countries will be accused of stealing the formula. And of course they will deny. This could potentially embarrass UNITED UNITED KDAEG. We would be forced to report that not only has the formula been completely erased from all databases, but also we do not know who did it. This is not an acceptable possible dcenario. We need in house intelligence. The British and Israelis have to prevent this.


The second reason reason reason for a British - Israeli coalition is that according to the Lawrence in Arabia book the British and French unfairly denied Palestinian Israelis land that their WW1 acts of Valor earned. If this is true and the book is considered credible, then the British government should rightfully help Palestine youth find meaningful gainful employment. Clearly, Israeli Jews might object However, it would appear that the Palestinians are in need of certain financial special consideration.
The WW1 Sykes agreement is disturbing.




So you are really going to assign a bunch of Israeli youth the task of guarding a Trillion dollar formula? Why not? What do we have to loose? Let's assume for argumentation the formula is stolen shortly after development. The next step is the technical investigation. That's the part where the culprits leave allegedly leave a technical trail back to themselves. What comes next? Then they get formally accused. And of course they demand proof. Then the accusers say the proof is classified. Then the accused say we'll, without public proof you have no case. And the accused walk. Face it. Technology alone does not solve technical crimes. We have nothing to loose by giving Israelis a chance to not only learn an old and respectable trade;but also a means to earn reasonable money.


So now UNITED UNITED KDAEG has to call the Chinese, German and the American governments and say that your 250 Billion dollar investment has been stolen. And we have no idea what exactly happened. The American government is going to respond fast. The money is going to be a major issue. If UNITED UNITED KDAEG is investigated at least we know we helped someone. As we see this, we have nothing to loose by hiring the British and Israelis.


How strong evidence are you expecting from the British and the the Israelis?
Watch the following clip from the United Nations in the 1960's.
https://youtu.be/xgR8NjNw__I


This clip is an example of insufficient evidence. Now watch the movie version in the movie 13 Days.
https://youtu.be/xgR8NjNw__I


In the movie version the Russians seam to acknowledge “OK. You got us. We concede… “
The movie version is an example of sufficient evidence. The other side must gesture some kind of defeat.
We expect evidence strong enough to garner admitted defeat.




Finally, pay close attention to your trainers. As long as Putin, Merkel and and Xi are in control you will have little real work. After that it gets more challenging. Watch this movie.

According to Wikipedia Kim's first successful space launch was the Unha-3 in 2012. However the Korean government says that the Unha-1 was Kim's first successful launch was the Unha-2 rocket in 2009.
See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unha
Either way Kim achieves his first rocket launch at a very early age, still in his 20's


Both were young when made first space launches.
Von Braun born in 1912. V2 Rocket in service by 1944. See

GAME PLAY




The game objective is to get as many cards in a suit as possible comprised of as many different countries as possible. For example, 4 different country premodern diamonds. Another example is 5 different country enviro-modern hexagons. See example card hands:

Try printing country goals on slides in slide document program. Each time a country character lands on any country square, the player draws a country card. The board squares are labeled similarly to the cards. If a player collects three cards of one country, that player may exchange his cards for a restaurant token to be placed on the country square the next time the player character lands on any of that country's squares. For now the black and red tokens are restaurants. The player collecting the most restaurants wins game.


Premodern: hearts
Modern: diamonds
Postmodern: spades
Money: clubs












All country pieces begin on START. Roll die. Count number of board squares counter clockwise the number of squares as shown on die. After country piece lands on the representative country square the die is thrown a second time to determine whether player faces a premodern, modern, postmodern or modern-environmental situation.


1. Players choose a country and its token game character ambassador.


1. Players place their game character ambassador tokens on the green START square on the board.


1. Players roll die and move game character ambassador tokens counterclockwise around the board according to the die roll.


1. When a country character ambassador token lands on a country square, the player collects any card they want in the deck that belongs to that country.


1. When a country character ambassador lands on a special numbered square, they perform the action associated with that square explained on the Square Table Summary Chart. These actions are collect, trade or loose additional country cards.


1. Players continue rolling die, moving country ambassador tokens and collecting or losing cards. Eventually a player collects all the cards of his country needed to form either a green or blue card flush. This player then turns all their cards over face-up. That player wins the game.


1. Note, game time can be shortened by pre-dealing some of the cards before starting to play.


Roll die to move country pieces around board. Each country has 3 board squares - two outer neutral squares and 1 inner loose card square. If the piece lands on a neutral square, then the player does not loose that country card if they have it. But, if the country piece lands on a loose card square, then the player looses that ountry card; or one card of that country








Four board corner squares are player show card squares. If a country piece lands on these squares, then the player shows his country cards if he has all four (premodern, modern, postmodern and monetary) cards of that country.


There are also two collect card board squares.
4 country.


At the end of game each player adds up all cards.
If he has more premodern cards, then he prays about issues.
If he has more modernist cards, then he does the issue.
If he has more postmodern cards, then he discusses the issues.
If he has more monetary cards, then he is paid for the issues.


In other words the Chinese player needs hexagon flush suit to win.
Postmodernism wins with a postmodern multiple suit flush.
Premodernism wins with diamond flush.








Winning The Game:
First country to collect a green card (Environment Flush) wins the game. Symbolically, that country successfully developed the oil additive, establish a global environmental protection insurance plan and design a global green rail. Second place is awarded to the first country to achieve a blue card flush. However, blue card flush can win if another country is unable to achieve a green card flush. The blue card flush symbolizes completion of a global energy carbon reduction plan.


Note, Java programming can help develop the game if it's output was screenshoted and pasted into the website.


The Java subroutine can print the card flushes.


Discussion


Facebook Alternative and Navy Alternative Hurricane Rescue Plan




Some people might respond that KDAEG is both too futuristic and too expensive.  Who can we call now - that can fly on this for real today? Facebook is the next best solution. Facebook already has a start-up disaster page. See https://www.facebook.com/disaster. There might be many more similar pages than only this one. But, this was the first disaster related Facebook page found in a quick search. It can be modified according to the following plan.






Assume in Summer 2019 a category 4 hurricane is projected to directly  hit Miami, Florida. Assume 100,000 people actually got hit and there is severe flooding.


  





Assume they have no power and all major roads are down. Assume there are 50,000 severe medical emergencies. Clearly, this is a bad picture.  Now consider the following picture in comparison.










Assume the above Facebook page has a formally designated Hurricane Medical Group. This is a group of 10,000 worldwide doctors who are formally on call for environmental disaster assistance. This probably already exists. But, if one googles “doctors on call for hurricane help,” a group like this does not very clearly pop-up. Next assume the above Facebook page also has a formal commercial aircraft group. United is the designated disaster relief carrier for this simulation.




  



Now Assume the above Facebook disaster page also has a formally designated environmental disaster hotel group. This is a group of Hotels that have agreed to be environmental disaster relief locations in the event of severe hurricanes. Assume in this case JW Marriott Marquis Miami is the lead Hotel for this simulation.




  



  

Miami Airport Hotel










Assume the United States Navy also has a group on the above Facebook disaster page. The commander of the United States Navy helicopter carrier USS America (LHA-6) regularly monitors the page. His boat is on the East Coast. They are standing by and ready.
  







Assume The White House has a group on the above designated Facebook page. Assume the The White House group senior communications officer has enough designated disaster relief authority to directly communicate with the commander aboard the USS America.




Assume that popular map data corporations have groups on the above Facebook page. They are monitoring the situation and are waiting instruction.


Assume the Miami, Florida fire department has a group on the above Facebook page.


Assume that the family members of the 50,000 medical casualties have enough remaining laptop battery power to start logging onto the above Facebook page; and now requesting help.  The fire department can get to many of the requests. But, the fire department can not move all of the patients.


Assume the lead doctor of the medical group on the above Facebook page just posted that he has now 350 medical personnel at the Marriott. The fire chief wants to pass the geographical coordinates, provided by Google and Apple, of the casualties to the carrier commander.


Assume that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also has a group on the above Facebook disaster page. The FEMA Facebook disaster page communications officer just posted that FEMA is still heavily engaged in North Carolina, that was hit by another hurricane only two weeks earlier. FEMA needs five more days before it can meaningfully respond the current hurricane disaster in Miami. Furthermore, FEMA passes temporary full federal disaster relief authority of this Miami hurricane response to The White House communications officer of the above Facebook disaster relief page. The White House officer immediately clears the Technology Company 1 and Technology Company 2 disaster relief groups to digitally pass the geographical coordinates of the worst hurricane patients, as designated by the Miami Fire department, to the helicopter carrier commander. Three days later 60% of the casualties had received medical help, helicopter lifted to surrounding airports and flown by UNITED AIRLINES to the nearest available hospitals. In summary, the above Facebook disaster relief page is best initial platform to coordinate a hurricane disaster relief plan like the one above.


In conclusion Facebook has at least two additional benefits. First the Facebook pages platform is 100% transparent. So if part of the emergency response operations encounters overwhelming challenges, others monitoring the page can reinforce support. Second, Facebook is a smart company. This means that if necessary Facebook could both administratively and technologically simultaneously coordinate two or three other environmental emergency responses like the one above.


  





















































Conclusion -




The New EU:


When countries join together for the purpose of highly efficient strategic maximation of gross product research, development and sales; increased [shared] financial gain is the most likely result. This money can be used not only for special environmental product development and sales but also to financially aid the homeless, prostitutes and students. An unofficial estimate of 30% of gross revenue should be able to be donated. But, the donations have some conditions, such as eventual employment by receivers to this organization. Employment is not necessarily in the country of initial assistance. The following are the initial cities of aid to homeless, prostitutes and students:

Hong Kong, China
Tokyo, Japan
Honolu, Hawaii Hawaii, USA
London, England
West Bank, Israel
Accra, Ghana
San Juan, Puerto Rico

In closing it is important to draw lines between a fictional game and the real world. We at UNITED KDAEG want to share with you a very real and special song from the old 1980s band Band Aid.

This summarizes the game.The game illustrates how countries, dubbed The New EU, applying modernist philosophy not only become more financially efficient; but also more grounded in environmental products and services.

    	/* From Sam's Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours:
    	
    	  Hour 6: Using Strings to Communicate.
    	
        (p. 71) Strings text and show it on screen to readers.
        
        A single character is is a text type of information.
        
        Character variables are created wth the 'char' type. See example:
        
        char squareLetter = 'a';
        
        
        
        A string is a set of characters. A 'String' variable that holds characters is
        initialized with 'String' followed by the variable 'name.' See example:
        
        String countryName1 = "Britain";
        
        Note; other variable types such as int, float, char, boolean, etc. are not captitalized. But, "String" is captitalized.
        
        
        Showing text on a computer screen is called printing. It is done with the
        'println()' statement. This statement displyays string characters and variables inside the parentheses. Example:
        
        System.out.prinln();
        
        This displays exact text within double quotation marks inside the parentheses. And variables too. Another similar command is
        
        System.out.print();
        
        This command is used when several different values are to be printed in a row on the same line. Example:
        
        System.out.print ("There's ");
        System.out.print ("a ");
        System.out.print ("shark ");
        System.out.print ("in ");
        System.out.print ("in your pool.");
        
        System.out.println().
        
        The last line 'System.out.println()' ends the line.
